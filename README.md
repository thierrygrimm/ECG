[ECG](https://github.com/thierrygrimm/ECG) provides different resources to evaluate electrocardiogram (ECG) data more streamlined. 


## Organization
### Foundations 

**What is an electrocardiogram?**
 An electrocardiogram is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using differently placed electrode (conductive pads) configurations also called leads. They detect muscle depolarization and repolarization during each cardiac cycle. It can help diagnose cardiac rhythm disturbances, inadequate coronary artery blood flow or electrolyte disturbances.


**How can it be interpreted?**
Interpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition.
A typical caridac rhythm produces four entities â€“ a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave. One pass is initiated by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. The electrical depolarization spreads through the atria, the atrioventricular node, the His bundle, Purkinje fibers and the ventricles.

## Sections
### Axial Deviation

The hexaxial reference system also known as the Cabrera system is a convention to present the extremity leads of an electrocardiogram (ECG). It can determine the projected vector of a heart's electrical axis onto the frontal plane.

Different types of axial deviation types are attributed to different amplitudes and directions of the R-peaks.

By adding R-peak amplitude weighted vectors of leads in the Cabrera circle one can quantitatively determine the heart's electrical axis on the frontal plane. By inputting those relative values the notebook calculates the according vector:
